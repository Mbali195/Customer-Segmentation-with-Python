# Customer-Segmentation-with-Python
Using customer data to segment customers

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to leverage Python for obtaining valuable customer insights, aiding in the identification of specific customer groups that a retail company should prioritize. By analyzing key customer attributes, the project aims to understand their spending habits and demographic backgrounds.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project comprises the following features:
- Sex
- Marital Status
- Age
- Education
- Income
- Occupation
- Settlement Size

## Segmentation Methodology
The project utilized various clustering techniques, including K-means, dendrogram analysis, and clustering algorithms, to segment customers based on their attributes and behavior.

## Python Libraries and Tools
The project made use of several Python libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- SciPy for scientific computing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and K-means clustering

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values or inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized data distributions and relationships between customer attributes.
3. **Standardization:** Utilized Scikit-learn for standardizing the data to ensure uniform scaling.
4. **Clustering Techniques:** Applied K-means and dendrogram analysis to segment customers into distinct groups.

## Results and Interpretation
The customer segmentation revealed distinct clusters based on demographic and behavioral characteristics. Insights obtained assist the retail company in understanding customer spending patterns, thereby enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## Instructions for Replication
To replicate the project results:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
3. Run the provided Python script, following the comments and instructions for each step.

## Additional Information
Challenges Faced:
- Addressed missing values and outliers in the dataset to ensure accurate clustering.
- Optimized clustering algorithms for better segmentation accuracy.

Future Improvements:
- Explore additional clustering algorithms for comparison and enhanced segmentation accuracy.
- Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast customer behavior based on segments.
